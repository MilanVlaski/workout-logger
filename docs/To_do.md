- [x] Use oat.ink to restyle everything ~~Make textarea look the same as the input?~~
- [ ] Currently, the code either clones <template>s, in the very .html file, or it uses innerHTML as a string.Use webc from 11ty, to create <template> to clone in the component itself, and instead of innerHTML, also use a cloneable template, invoked in the render() method. ~~Switch to fragment cloning~~
- [ ] Add reset icon to the right of buttons, in case users mistype
- [ ] Add x buttons to the top-right of the current exercise "elements", when they're appended.
- [ ] Date must come from today.
- [ ] Disable "Remove reps" while there is only one reps input
  - [ ] ~~Make disabled look good in my-css~~
- [ ] Make the "focus event" on the all-reps, hit the LAST input
